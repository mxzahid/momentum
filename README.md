## 🧮 Momentum Scoring

The momentum score uses exponential decay:

```swift
momentumScore = 100 * exp(-daysSinceActivity / 10.0)
```

- **100%**: Activity today
- **~50%**: 7 days inactive
- **~10%**: 30 days inactive
- **0%**: Never active

### Status Levels
- 🟢 **Active**: ≤2 days
- 🟡 **Cooling**: 3-7 days
- 🟠 **Inactive**: 8-30 days
- 🔴 **Dormant**: >30 days


## ⚙️ Configuration

### Settings Location
- Preferences: `~/Library/Preferences/com.momentum.app.plist`
- Database: `~/Library/Application Support/Momentum/momentum.sqlite3`

### Customization
- **Nudge Frequency**: 1-168 hours (default: 24h)
- **Quiet Hours**: Customize do-not-disturb times
- **Watch Folders**: Add/remove project directories
- **Motivation Style**: Change at any time in settings

## 🔒 Privacy

- **100% Local**: All data stays on your Mac
- **No Cloud**: No server sync, no account required
- **Metadata Only**: Only reads timestamps and git stats, never code content
- **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking or analytics
