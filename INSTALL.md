## Installation

### Method 1: DMG (Recommended)
1. Open the downloaded `Momentum.dmg` file
2. Drag `Momentum.app` to your Applications folder
3. Eject the DMG

### Method 2: ZIP
1. Double-click `Momentum.zip` to extract
2. Move `Momentum.app` to your Applications folder

## First Launch

Since this app is not notarized with Apple (to keep it free), macOS will show a security warning on first launch. This is normal and safe.

### Option A: Right-Click Method (Easiest)
1. Go to your Applications folder
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on `Momentum.app`
3. Click **Open** from the menu
4. Click **Open** again in the dialog that appears
5. The app will launch and this permission is remembered

### Option B: System Settings Method
1. Try to open Momentum normally (it will be blocked)
2. Go to **System Settings** â†’ **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to find the message about Momentum
4. Click **Open Anyway**
5. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

### Option C: Terminal Method (Advanced Users)
If you're comfortable with the terminal, you can remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Momentum.app
```

After running this command, Momentum will open normally without any warnings.

## System Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Approximately 2 MB of disk space

## Troubleshooting

### "Momentum is damaged and can't be opened"
This happens when the quarantine attribute is set. Use Option C above (Terminal Method) to fix it.

### App won't open after following the steps
Try these in order:
1. Make sure you're running macOS 13.0 or later
2. Restart your Mac and try again
3. Re-download the app (the download may have been corrupted)

### The app opens but crashes immediately
Check Console.app for error messages or open an issue on GitHub with details about your system.

## Uninstalling

To remove Momentum from your Mac:
1. Quit the app if it's running
2. Delete `Momentum.app` from your Applications folder
3. Delete app data (optional):
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Momentum
   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/Momentum
   ```
